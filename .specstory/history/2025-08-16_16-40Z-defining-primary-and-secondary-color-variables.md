primary and secondary color css variable

_**Assistant**_

I'll add primary and secondary color CSS variables to your stylesheet. Let me update the `style.css` file to include these color variables.


---

```diff
      box-sizing: border-box;
  }
+ 
+ :root {
+     --primary-color: #2563eb;
+     --secondary-color: #7c3aed;
+     --primary-light: #3b82f6;
+     --primary-dark: #1d4ed8;
+     --secondary-light: #8b5cf6;
+     --secondary-dark: #6d28d9;
+ }
  
  
```

---

Perfect! I've added primary and secondary color CSS variables to your stylesheet. Here's what I included:

**Primary Colors:**
- `--primary-color`: A vibrant blue (#2563eb)
- `--primary-light`: A lighter blue variant (#3b82f6) 
- `--primary-dark`: A darker blue variant (#1d4ed8)

**Secondary Colors:**
- `--secondary-color`: A purple (#7c3aed)
- `--secondary-light`: A lighter purple variant (#8b5cf6)
- `--secondary-dark`: A darker purple variant (#6d28d9)

You can now use these variables throughout your CSS like this:
```css
.button {
    background-color: var(--primary-color);
    color: white;
}

.accent {
    background-color: var(--secondary-color);
}
```

The colors I chose are modern and accessible, with good contrast ratios. Feel free to adjust the hex values to match your preferred color scheme!

I'll add hover effects using the primary color to the dropdown items in your navigation. Let me update the CSS to include hover styles for the dropdown menu items.


---

```diff
      --bs-dropdown-link-hover-bg: #173555
  }
+ 
+ .navbar-dark .dropdown-menu .dropdown-item:hover {
+     background-color: var(--primary-color);
+     color: white;
+ }
+ 
+ .navbar-dark .dropdown-menu .dropdown-item:active {
+     background-color: var(--primary-color);
+     color: white;
+ }
  
  /* Utility */
```

Perfect! I've added hover effects using your primary color (#609513 - the green color) to the dropdown menu items. Now when you hover over items like "ক্লাস ১ ভর্তি", "ফর্ম পূরণ", or "সাহায্য কেন্দ্র", they will:

- Change background color to your primary green color
- Change text color to white for better contrast
- Also apply the same styling when the item is active/clicked

The hover effect will make the navigation more interactive and visually appealing while maintaining consistency with your color scheme.

hover to primary color

_**Assistant**_

I see you want to add hover effects to the primary color for the dropdown items. I've already added that in the previous update! The dropdown items now have hover effects that use your primary color (#609513).

However, if you'd like me to make any adjustments to the hover styling or if you want to add hover effects to other elements, please let me know. The current hover effect will:

- Change the background to your primary green color when hovering over dropdown items
- Change the text to white for better contrast
- Apply the same styling when items are active/clicked

Is there something specific you'd like me to modify about the hover effect, or would you like me to add hover effects to other elements as well?
